<h1>Sound Doctrine</h1>
<h2>With Rick Hofmeister</h2>
<div>


  <p>The phrase “sound doctrine” translates Greek terms meaning “healthy teaching”; teaching that promotes the spiritual
    health of the listener.
    <br>
    <br>
    The purpose of the Sound Doctrine broadcast is found in Titus 1:9 – “holding fast the faithful word which is in
    accordance with the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who
    contradict.”
    <br>
    <br>
    It is the mission of Sound Doctrine to communicate systematically the doctrines found in the Bible and identify
    erroneous teaching, to the benefit of all who hear.</p>
